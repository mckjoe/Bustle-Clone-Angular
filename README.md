# BustleClone

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5. BustleClone is a clone of the real website `bustle.com`.  The site should allow users to view a list of blogs or articles, and let them click on the one they would like to view.

## Description

The BustleClone is a website people can visit and find interesting articles/blogs to read. The articles are displayed as boxes on the screen with an image, a quick description of what the article contains and the authors name.  Users should be able to click on an article and be routed to a new page that contains the full article, as well as a series of photos that are much larger than the ones in the thumb nails.  One thing that seemed to me like Bustle is missing as far as a user standpoint goes is that there is no clear button that will take you back to the main page where you started from, so I think I will try to add that to each article instead of having more articles appear as you scroll down the screen.
